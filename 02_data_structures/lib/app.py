# Sequence Types

# Creating Lists
#1. ✅ Create a list of 10 pet names
pet_names = ["Tracker", "Boba", "Willow", "Winry", "Ziggy", "Leo", "Lucy", "Abe", "Quinn", "Ruby"]

# Reading Information from Lists
# 2. ✅ Return the first pet name
 
# 3. ✅ Return all pet names beginning from the 3rd index

#4. ✅ Return all pet names before the 3rd index

#5. ✅  Return all pet names beginning from the 3rd index and up to the 7th]

#6. ✅ Find the index of a given element

#7. ✅ Reverse the original list

#8. ✅ Return the frequency of a given element 

# Updating Lists
#9. ✅ Change the first element to all uppercase 

# Adding items to list
#10. ✅ Append a new name to the list

#11. ✅ Add a new name at a specific index

#12. ✅ Add two lists together 

# Removing 
#13. ✅ Remove the final element from the list

#14. ✅ Remove element by specific index

#15. ✅ Remove a specific element 

#16. ✅ Remove all pet names from the list

#Tuple 
# 📚 Review With Students:
    # Mutable, Immutable, Changeable, Unchangeable

#17. ✅ Create a Tuple of pet 10 ages 

#18. ✅ Print the first pet age


# Testing Changeability 
#19. ✅ Attempt to remove an element with .pop (should error)
# -> AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'pop' 

#20. ✅ Attempt to change the first element (should error)
# -> TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

# Tuple Methods
#21. ✅ Return the frequency of a given element

#22. ✅ Return the index of a given element 


#23. ✅ Create a range 
#Note Ranges are primarily used in loops


# Demo Sets (stretch goal)
#24. ✅ Create a set of 3 pet foods


# Demo Dictionaries 
# Creating 
#25. ✅  Create a dictionary of pet information with the keys name, age and breed


#26. ✅  Use dict to create a dictionary of pet information with the keys name, age and breed


# Reading
#27. ✅ Print the pet attribute of name using bracket notation 


#28. ✅ Print the pet attribute of age using .get
#Note: get is preferred over bracket notation in most cases because it will return none instead of an error

# Updating 
#29. ✅ Update the pets age to 12

#30. ✅ Update the other pets age to 26

# Deleting
#30. ✅ Delete a pets age using the del keyword 


#31. ✅ Delete the other pets age using the .pop 


#32. ✅ Delete the last item in the pet dictionary using popitem()


# Demo Loops 
pet_info = [
    {
        'name':'rose',
        'age':11,
        'breed': 'domestic long-haired',
    }, 
    {
        'name':'spot',
        'age':25,
        'breed': 'boxer',
    },
    {
        'name':'Meow Meow Beans',
        'age':2,
        'breed': 'domestic long-haired',
    }
    ]
#33. ✅ loop through a range of 10 and print every number within the range


#34. ✅ loop through a range between 50 and 60 that iterates by 2 and print every number


#35. ✅ Loop through the pet_info list and print every dictionary  


#36. ✅ Create a function that takes a list as an argument. 
    # The function should use a for loop to loop through the list and print every item in the list 
    # Invoke the function and pass it pet_names as an argument


#37. ✅ Create a function that takes a list as an argument.(simple example) 
    # The function should define a counter and set it to 0
    # Create a while loop 
        # The loop will continue as long as the counter is less than the length of the list
        # Every loop should increase the count by 1
    # return the counter 


#38. ✅ Create a function that updates the age of a given pet
        # The function should take a list of dicts, name and age as parameters 
        # Create a index variable and set it to 0
        # Create a while loop. 
            # The loop will continue so long as the list does not contain a name matching the name param and the index is less then the length of the list
            # Every list will increase the index by 1
        # If the dict containing a matching name is found update the items age with the new age 
        # else return 'pet not found'


# map like 
#39. ✅ Use list comprehension to return a list containing every pet name from pet_info changed to uppercase

# find like
#40. ✅ Use list comprehension to find a pet named spot

# filter like
# 41. ✅ Use list comprehension to find all of the pets under 3 years old

# 43. ✅ Create a generator expression matching the filter above. Compare and contrast the generator to the list comprehension.
