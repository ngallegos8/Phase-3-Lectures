#OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concepts of objects or dictionaries
#For example an object can represent a person and have properties like name, address
#Behavior or methods like walking, or running

#Benefits
#Code resuse, modualarity, readable, problem solving, inheritance

#Principles
# Single Responsibility Principle: 
    #classes in oop should have one responsibility, and methods should be aligned with that responsibility
# Separation of concern: 
    #The idea that the various responsibilities, or concerns, of a computer program should be separated
# Domain Modeling: 
    # A method to describe and model entities and the relationships between them
# Abstraction: 
    #representing complex real-world problems in a simplified manner by focusing on the most relevant aspects and ignoring the rest.
# Encapsulation: 
    #the idea of keeping the internal workings of an object hidden from the outside world.
# Inheritance: 
    #the ability for objects to inherit properties and behaviors from other objects.
# Polymorphism: the ability for objects to take on multiple forms
